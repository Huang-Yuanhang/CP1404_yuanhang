# Reflection

## Task Estimates and Accuracy
My accuracy in task estimation has improved greatly over the course of this subject. As I progressed through the course, 
I gained a better understanding of the pace of my work and the complexity of different coding tasks.


## Code Reviews
While undergoing the review process, I learned the importance of writing concisely and readably. 
The feedback helped me identify and correct coding style issues, potential errors, and areas for 
improvement. In addition, code reviews have broadened my programming knowledge by exposing me 
to different coding styles and techniques.

## Practical Tasks Overall
If I were in charge of this subject, I would consider the following changes:

1. **Clearer Task Descriptions:** Ensure that practical task descriptions are precise and include all necessary 
     information. Clearer task instructions can reduce ambiguity and improve the overall 
     understanding of what is expected.

2. **Additional Real-world Scenarios:** Incorporate more real-world scenarios into practical tasks. While academic
     exercises are valuable, exposing students to practical, industry-related problems can better 
     prepare them for future work in the field.

3. **Integration of Emerging Technologies:** Stay up-to-date with emerging technologies and trends in the field. 
     Consider integrating relevant technologies or frameworks to ensure students are exposed to 
     the most current tools and practices.
