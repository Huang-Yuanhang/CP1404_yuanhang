## Clean Code Lessons

CP1404 has taught me some important lessons about 'clean code', including these:
1. **Meaningful Variable and Function Names**: The names used for variables and functions should be 
     descriptive, easy to read and clear.

2. **Modularization**: Breaking code into smaller, reusable functions or modules.

3. **Commenting and Documentation**: Writing clear comments and documentation is crucial
     for explaining the code's purpose, usage, and any potential gotchas to other developers.
